# Olfaction-Properties-and-molecules-smell-relationahip
A Graph Neural Network project - This project aims to predict the chemical molecules smell depending on its olfaction properties.

Documented Work: 
		Olfaction Properties.pdf

Dataset: 
	FlavorDB_manual_none.csv
	FlavorDB_manual_none.txt

Python code:
	    1. compound_to_smiles_string - converting compound name to SMILES string
	    2. smile_graph.py - Getting the adjacency matrix
	    3. GCN2_data_handling.py - For extracting the atoms and their bonds, MACCS properties

Output files:
	    in mydataset folder
